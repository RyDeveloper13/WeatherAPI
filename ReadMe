#Weather Dashboard - Backend Development with TypeScript
##This project is a backend service for a Weather Dashboard application that allows users to search for and view current and 5-day weather forecasts for various cities. The backend integrates with the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data, stores search history in a JSON file, and supports CRUD operations for managing city records. The entire application is built with TypeScript for enhanced reliability and maintainability and is deployed on Render.
